1. Breast, 12 o'clock direction, 2-cm from the nipple/areola right, simple mastectomy, grade 3/3 invasive ductal carcinoma of no sepcial type (ductal NST, tumor size measuirng 21-mm in greatest dimension, according to the Nottingham modification of the Bloom-Richardson System: point of tubule formation = 3, nuclear pleomorphism = 3, and mitotic count = 3; total score = 3+3+3=9/9) composed of pleomorphic tumor cells arranged in trabecular, corded, and nested configurations with moderate lymphoplasmacytic tumor-host reaction, significant fibrosis of tumor stroma, indistinct tumor necrosis, and frequent peritumoral lymphovascular permeation and perineural invasion.        
2. Breast, 2 o'clock direction, 3-cm from the main tumor, right, simple mastectomy, another separated locus grade 3/3 invasive ductal carcinoma of no sepcial type (ductal NST, tumor size measuirng 9-mm in greaetst dimension, according to the Nottingham modification of the Bloom-Richardson System: point of tubule formation = 3, nuclear pleomorphism = 3, and mitotic count = 3; total score = 3+3+3=9/9) composed of pleomorphic tumor cells arranged in trabecular, corded, and nested configurations with mild lymphoplasmacytic tumor-host reaction, fibrosis of tumor stroma, indistinct tumor necrosis, focal peritumoral lymphovascular permeation, and no definite perineural invasion identified.    
3. Surgical margin, peripheral, superficial and basal, right breast, simple mastectomy, free of tumor invasion and in situ lesion with the closest basal margin (1-mm in distance from the invasive tumor) 
4. Breast, non-tumor, right, simple mastectomy, skipped perivascular satellite-like nodules by grade 3/3 invasive ductal carcinoma of no sepcial type (ductal NST, tumor size about 4-mm in greatest diameter, leaving 20-mm in distance from the main tumor and 10-mm in distance from 3 o'clock peripheral margin) in the fibrocystic background with adjacent pagetoid ductal spreading and lobular cancerization by cribriform intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ (up to 3-mm in diameter) and patchy sclerosing adenosis and evident stromal fibrosis.
5. Skin, right breast, simple mastectomy, free of tumor invasion, DCIS lesion or Paget's cells.
7. Lymph node, sentinel, axillary, right, lymphadenectomy, metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma of no sepcial type (intranodal lesion about 5-mm in maximal diameter) without extranodal soft tissue extension (1/17).  
8. Ancillary test for invasive tumor cells: (section B6)
     ER: positive, 4/4, 95%, evident nuclei staining, intensity and proportion: mild(35%), moderate(30%), strong(30%)
     PR: positive, 4/4, 95%, evident nuclei staining, intensity and proportion: moderate(25%), strong(70%)
     AR: positive, 4/4, 70%, evident nuclei staining, intensity and proportion: mild(40%), moderate(30%)
     HER-2/neu: weakly positive, score 2+, intensity and proportion: weak incomplete membranous staining(45%), moderate complete membranous staining(15%).
     E-Cadherin: positive, strong membraneous staining
     P63: loss of peripheral myoepithelial expression in the invasive components
     CK5/14: loss of peripheral myoepithelial expression in the invasive components
     Ki-67 proliferation index: about 23%
     EGFR: positive, mild membrane stain in 2% tumor cells
     Phosphahistone 3 (average mitotic count: 38/10 HPFs)
     consistent with the immunosurrogates suggestive of ductal carcinoma NST of luminal B or luminal B-Her2 genotype (depending on Her2-FISH result).
9. Her2-FISH study: already arranged and will be performed (in block B6) as soon as possible. 
10. Pathologic staging: T2(m)N1a,cM0, stage IIB (AJCC 7th edition, 2010, combined with the previously frozen report of 201406192 for sentinel lymph nodes).
[描述]
     The specimen submitted consists of two bags of tissue labeled as: 1:right breast and 2: axillary LN, respectively fixed in formalin (tissue take out time: 11:15 and fixation time 12:25 on 02/24; sampled time: 14:30 on 02/25; tumor part cut open previously).
     Specimen 1 consists of the breast tissue measuring 15x15x4-cm in size. The overlying skin is 10.5x4.5-cm in dimension with nipple included. It is tied with two stitches at 12 o'clock margin and one stitch at 3 o'clock margin. On cut, there is a well-defined whitish, elastic-firm tumor, measuring 2.1x1.7x1.5-cm in size, locating at 12 o'clock direction, 2-cm from the nipple/areola . There are also another nodules measuring up to 0.9x0.8-cm in dimension, locating at 12-3 o'clock direction, measuring 1.3-cm in distance from the main tumor, and close to 3 o'clock peripheral margin. The overlying skin is unremarkable and free of tumor invasion. The tumor measures about 2.5-cm , 1.0-cm , 7.0-cm, 6.5-cm, 0.1-cm and 1.5-cm from the 12/3/6/9 o'clock peripheral margin, basal and superficial margin, respectively. The breast elsewhere also reveals small nodules and fibrosis change.
     Specimen 2 consists of more than ten fibroadipose tissue fragments measuring up to 5x4x2-cm in size. They are yellow and elastic. Several lymph node measuring up to 1.6x0.7x0.6-cm in size are dissected and sampled.

     Representative sections are taken and labeled as:   Jar 2
     A1-4: the main tumor with basal margin (basal margin inked green)
     A5: tumor and superficial margin
     A6: the other separate tumor very close to the superficial margin  
     B1-4: 12/3/6/9 o'clock peripheral margin (en-face)
     B5: tumor and superficial margin (inked orange)
     B6: tumor and basal margin (inked green)
     C1: elsewhere, 12-3 o'clock direction
     C2: elsewhere, 3-6 o'clock direction
     C3: elsewhere, 6-9 o'clock direction
     C4: elsewhere, 9-12 o'clock direction
     C5: skin and nipple
     D1-3: axillary lymph nodes
