[描述]
Gross description:
      The specimen is submitted into 4 bags labeled as 1. L't breast mass, 2. Margin: 2-3 o'clock, 3. Margin: 4 o'clock, 4. Axillary lymph nodes, fixed in formalin. No tissue fixation and resection time is available.
      The specimen 1 consists of one conserving removed breast tissue measuring 6x3.5x4cm in size. Overlying skin measures 5x2cm in dimension. No nipple and areola is included. Grossly, there is one white, firm, and irregular tumor measuring 2.1x2.0 cm in size. The tumor measures 1.3cm, 1.3cm, 1.3cm and 1.0cm away from peripheral resection margins at 12, 3, 6, 9 o'clock direction, respectively. No remarkable change of the skin tissue.
     The specimen labeled as additional margin of 2-3 o'clock measures  3.2x2x0.5cm in size with clip for labeling direction. On section, no tumor mass is identified.
     The specimen labeled as additional margin of 4o'clock measures 1.8x1.4x0.5cm in size with clip for labeling direction. On section, no tumor mass is identified.
      The specimen 4 contains one soft tissue measuring up to 3x2x1 cm in size, respectively. Several lymph nodes are dissected.
      Representative tissues are taken and labeled as following:   Jar2
      (base ink: black, superficial ink red, 12-3 ink orange, 3-6 ink green, 6-9 ink yellow, 9-12 ink blue)
      A1-5: main tumor with greatest dimension, including 12,3,6,9 peripheral margin(mapping:A1-2,A3-4 )
      B1: base margin with tumor
      B2: superficial margin with tumor
      C1-2: additional margin of 2-3 o'clock(clip ink green, another side ink black) (all for section)
      D:additional margin of 4 o'clock(clip ink green, another side ink black) (all for section)
      E: axillary lymph node(all for section)

    base margin: free, 5 mm 
    separated margin of 2-3 o'clock: free of invasive carcinoma
    separated margin of 4 o'clock: free of invasive carcinoma
C. Nodal status: negative
    No. examined:7 (2 in specimen and 5 in frozen s2015-32652)
    No. macrometastases (>2 mm): 0
    No. micrometastases (>0.2 - 2 mm and/or >200 cells): 0

d. Pathologic Staging (pTNM)
   (A) Primary Tumor (pT):
     T2: Tumor greater than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension 
(B) Regional Lymph nodes (pN): (2 in this specimen and 5 in 
     N0: No regional lymph node metastases 
     Lymph node examintion: (0/7 )
   Pathologic staging: pT2,N0(sn)
e. Lymphovascular permeation: Present, section A3
   Perineural invasion: Present
f. Treatment Effect: not applicable.
g. Immunohistochemical study for invasive tumor cells: (section A2)
    ER: positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in 98% of tumor cell
    PR: positive, 4/4, moderate to strong nuclear staining in 98% of tumor cell
    Her2/neu: negative, score 1+
    CK5/14: loss of peripheral myoepithelial expression in the invasive components   
    E-cadherin: positive  
    Ki-67 proliferation index: 22%
    The immunoprofile suggest of type B molecular breast cancer
h. COMMENT
     All resection margin are free of tumor. The non-tumor part shows periductal inflammation, and stromal fibrosis. The skin is free of tumor or Paget's disease. No regional lymph node metastasis is identified. The additional margin of 2-3 o'clock shows focal  usual ductal hyperplasia, demostraed by CK5/14 staining and free of tumor. The additional margin of 4 o'clock is free of tumor.
