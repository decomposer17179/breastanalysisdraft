      Microscopically, it shows a picture of pityriasiform dermatitis revealing mild to moderate layered orthokeratosis, focal parakeratosis, mild to moderate irregular acanthosis, evident basilar vacuolopathy and RBC extravasation in the lower epidermis and papillary dermis, marked lymphohistiocytic spongiotic exocytosis, scattered suprabasal keratinocyte apoptosis, and patchy superficial perivascular to interstitial lymphohistiocytic cell infiltration lacking of eosinophil, neutrophil, or plasma cell. No significant neutrophilic exocytosis, atypical lymphoid infiltrate, nor epithelial malignancy is seen. According to the above histopathological features, pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) could be firstly considered, until proven otherwise clinically.
