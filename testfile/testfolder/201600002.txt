      Microscopically, it shows a picture of benign phyllodes tumor composed of fibromyxoid stroma and intracanalicular growth pattern epithelium with low to moderatate stromal cellularity, evidence of periductal condensation of the stroma, minimal cellular atypia and silent mitotic activity of stromal cells. No stromal overgrowth or heterologous component is seen. The resection margin cannot be evaluated due to tissue fragmentation. Please correlate with clinical picture.
