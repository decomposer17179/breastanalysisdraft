1. Breast, 10'/1 cm, left, echo-guided biopsy, ductal carcinoma in situ.
2. Immunohistochemical study: E-cadherin(positive), CK5/14(negative), ER(positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in 99% tumor cells), PR(positive, 4/4, moderate to strong nuclear staining in 80% tumor cells).

      Microscopically, it shows a picture of ductal carcinoma in situ, solid type of breast (tentative grade: lintermediate). The ductal carcinoma in situ lesion measured 0.5 cm in greatest diameter. The immunohistochemical study reveals the tumor cells are E-cadherin(positive, strong membranous staining), CK5/14(negative), ER(positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in 99% tumor cells), PR(positive, 4/4, moderate to strong nuclear staining in 80% tumor cells) without loss peripheral P63 and CK5/14 staining.
