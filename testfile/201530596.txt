1. Breast, 2'/1 cm, left, echo-guided core needle biopsy, invasive ductal carcinoma (tentative grade: 2/3).
2. Immunohistochemical study: CK(positive), E-cadherin(positive), ER(positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in nearly 100% tumor cells), PR(positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in nearly 100% tumor cells), Her2/neu(negative, score 1+), Ki67 labeling index(3%).
[描述]
      The specimen submitted consists of three tissue fragments measuring up to 1.0x0.1x0.1 cm. in size fixed in formalin.

      Grossly, they are tan and elastic.

      Microscopically, it shows a picture of invasive ductal carcinoma (ductal carcinoma, NST) of breast (tentative grade: 2/3, according to Nottingham modification of Bloom-Richardson scoring system (tubular formation: 3; nuclear pleomorphism: 2; mitotic activity: 1; 6/9)). The invasive carcinoma measured 0.4 cm in greatest diameter. The immunohistochemical study reveals the tumor cells are CK(positive), E-cadherin(positive, strong membranous staining), CK5/14(negative), ER(positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in nearly 100% tumor cells), PR(positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in nearly 100% tumor cells), Her2/neu(negative, score 1+), Ki67 labeling index(3%)  with loss peripheral P63 and CK5/14 staining.
