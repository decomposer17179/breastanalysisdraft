7. Addition margina, specimen 2, excision, usual ductal hyperplasia (demonstrated by mosaic stain with CK5/14 ), sclerosing and classic adenosis, ductal dilation, stromal hyaline fibrosis in the fibrocystic background and no definite invasive tumor or DCIS lesion identified.
8. The immunohistohemical study for the primary invasive tumor cells (section A7): ER (positive, 4/4, moderate, and strong nuclear staining in 60%, and 35% of invasive tumor cells respectively), PR (positive, 2/4, mild, moderate, and strong nuclear staining 15%, 20%, and 10% of invasive tumor cells), PR ( negative, 0/4), AR (positive, 2/4, mild and moderate, nuclear staining 35% and 10% of invasive tumor cells), EGFR (negative, score 0), HER2/neu (weak positive, ++/+++, weak to focally moderate complete membranous staining in 15% of tumor cells, faint to weak incomplete membranous staining in 70% of tumor cells ), E-Cadherin (positive, evident membranous stain), CK5/14 (loss of expression in the invasive portion), p63 (loss peripheral nuclear expression in invasive region), and Ki-67 (low proliferation fraction: 18.9%), consistent with the immunoprofiles suggestive of luminal-B ductal carcinoma NST.
9. The Her2-FISH study: already arranged and will be performed as soon as possible.
10. Pathologic stage: rpT2Nx,cM0, stage II (AJCC, 2010).
[描述]
     The specimen is submitted in two separated bags labeled as 1: left breast tumor and 2: additional margin, fixed in formalin. Specimen is resected at 09:18 and fixed in formalin at 09:30. The specimen is cut opened while we received.
     Specimen 1 contains one breast tissue removed by partial mastectomy measures 5.5x6.0x3.0 cm in size. The overlying skin measures 4.0x0.7 cm in dimension included. It is tied with two long stitches at 12 o'clock direction, and one short stitch at 3 o'clock direction. There is an ill-defined, tan and elastic lesion, measuring 2.7 x 1.6 cm in dimension is noted. The tumor seems involved the 1-3 o'clock direction margin. The tumor measures 0.9 cm, 0.7 cm, and 1.9 cm in distance from 12, 6, 9 o'clock direction margin. It also measures 0.9 cm and 0.4 cm in distance from superficial and basal margin. All surgical margins are free of tumor except 1-3 o'clock direction margins. Remainder breast parenchyma reveals focal fibrotic change. The skin is unremarkable.
     Specimen 2 contains one tissue fragment measures 3.5x3.5x1.8 cm in size. On cut, it is unremarkable and no tumor-like lesion noted inside.

     Representative tissues are taken and labeled as following:          Jar 2
     A1-9, mapping: main tumor (A1-4, 6-9: mapping, A1-4: the greatest dimension, 12-3 o'clock margin: inked yellow, 3-6 o'clock margin: inked blue, 6-9 o'clock margin inked orange, 9-12 o'clock margin inked black)
     B1: tumor to 3-4 o'clock margins (base margin inked green) 
     B2: tumor to 6 o'clock margin (base margin inked green)
     B3: tumor to superficial margin inked red
     C1-6: addition margin (one side inked green and another side inked blue, all for section)

     For the microscopic descriptions, please refer to the region of diagnostic columns described in the vortext! Thanks !!
