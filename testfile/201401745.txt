1. Breast, left, upper outer quadrant, 8-12 o'clock position, breast conserving surgery, grade 1/3 invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (ductal NST, tumor size measuring 1.3-cm in maximal dimension, section A2, according to the Nottingham modification of the Bloom-Richardson System: point of tubule formation = 2, nuclear pleomorphism = 2, and mitotic count = 1; total score = 2+2+1 = 5/9) composed by tumor cells with mild nuclear pleomorphism arranged in tubular, trabecular or nested growth patterns with indistinct tumor necrosis, silent mitotic activity, frequent intra-tubular mucin production(50% in area), marked desmoplastic reaction, moderate lymphoplasmacytic tumor-host reaction, adjacent hemorrhage, fibrosis and granulation tissue formation, compatible with previous biopsy site, scattered low-grade cribriform or solid ductal carcinoma in situ(DCIS, size measuring up to 1.5-mm in maximal dimension) without central necrosis, scattered perineural invasion, and no definite lymphovascular permeation identified.    
2. Surgical margin, left breast, 3,6,9,12 o'clock, superficial and base, breast conserving surgery, free of tumor invasion, but focally very close at 3' margin(about 0.1-mm in distance, section A3).
3. Breast, left, non-tumor part, breast conserving surgery, stromal fibrosis , ductal ectasia, microglandular adenosis, columnar cell change, and no definite invasive tumor identified.
4. Surgical margin, separately submitted and labeled as "additional margin", free of tumor invasion or DCIS lesion.
5. Skin, right breast, free of tumor invasion or Paget's cells.
6. Lymph node, axillary, left, lymphadenectomy, free of tumor invasion(0/1).
7. The immunohistochemical study for the primary invasive tumor cells(section A6): 
     ER: positive, 4/4, evident nuclei staining, intensity and proportion: weak(10%), moderate(30%), strong(58%)
     PR: negative, 2/4, evident nuclei staining, intensity and proportion: weak(5%), moderate(10%), strong(10%)
     AR: positive, 4/4, evident nuclei staining, intensity and proportion: weak(10%), moderate(50%), strong(30%)
     HER-2/neu: negative, score 1, +/+++, weak incomplete membranous staining in about 10% of tumor cells.
     E-cadherin: positive, strong membranous staining.
     P63: loss of myoepithelial expression in invasive components.
     CK5/14: loss of myoepithelial expression in invasive components.
     Ki-67 proliferation index: about 6% in hot zone.
     EGFR: negative
     Synaptophysin: negative
     Chromogranin A: negative
     consistent with the immunosurrogates suggestive of ductal carcinoma NST of luminal-A genotype.
8. pTNM: pT1cN0(sn), cM0, stage IA (AJCC, 2010).
[描述]
The specimen is submitted in three bags labeled as 1.The breast tumor, 2.Additional margin, and 3.Non-sentinel enlarged ALNs, respectively, fixed in formalin. The tumor lesion has been cut as received.
      
     Specimen 1 removed by breast conserving surgery measures 5.0x3.9x2.5-cm in size and 20.0-gm in weight. The overlying skin measures 2.2x0.5-cm in dimension. The specimen had been cut at tumor portion when received and the direction at 12, 3 o'clock is orientated by sutures. There is a yellowish-white, firm, ill-defined mass, measuring 1.0x1.0-cm in dimension, with surrounding hemorrhage. It is 1.5-cm from superficial margin, 0.3-cm from base margin, and 1.5-cm, 0.3-cm, 0.4-cm and 0.5-cm away from peripheral margins at 12, 3, 6, 9 o'clock. All of the surgical margins are free of tumor grossly. The non-tumor breast tissue shows focal fibrotic change. 
     Specimen 2 labeled as "Additional margin" consist of one breast tissue measuring 3.3x2.0x1.0-cm in size. It is tan and elastic.      
     Specimen 3 labeled as "Non-sentinel enlarged ALNs" consist of one piece of fibroadipose tissue measuring 4.0x3.0x1.5-cm in size. Grossly, it is yellow and soft. Several lymph nodes are dissected. 
     
     Representative tissues are taken and labeled as following:  Jar 2.
     A1-2: tumor and biopsy site, with peripheral margins(mapping, 12' margin inked yellow, 3' margin inked green, 6' margin inked ornage, 9' margin inked blue)
     A3-7: peritumoral fibrotic area, with peripheral margins
     B1-2: superficial margin(perpendicular, inked red)
     B3-4: base margin(perpendicular, inked black)
     C: skin
     D1-5: additional margin(all for section, one margin inked orange, another margin inked green)
     E1-4: right axillary lymph nodes(all for section)
