1. Breast, right, breast conserving surgery, grade 1/3 ductal carcinoma NST (invasive tumor measuring 0.4-cm in maximal dimension, according to the Nottingham modification of the Bloom-Richardson System: point of tubule formation= 3, nuclear pleomorphism= 1, and mitotic count= 1; total score = 3+1+1=5/9) composed of monotonous cuboidal tumor cells revealing enlarged and pleomorphic nuclei and inconspicuous mitotic activity arranged in cords or small nests infiltrating in fibrotic stroma with multfocal grade 1-2/3 cribriform and solid ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS lesions up to 2.0-mm in diameter) containing intraluminal clustered granular to laminated microcalcifications and scattered punch-out necrosis, mild lymphoplasmacytic tumor-host reaction, and no definite peritumoral lymphovascular permeation nor perineural invasion identified. 
2. Surgical margin, right breast (bag 1), peripheral, base and anterior, breast conserving surgery, free of tumor invasion or DCIS lesion with the distance of 6.0-mm to closest base from invasive tumor and 1.0-mm to closest base from ductal carcinoma in situ.
3. Breast, labeled as additional margin, further excision, foci of solid or cribriform intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ (estimating up to 1.5-mm in dimension, confirmed by CK5/14 stain in section D2), stromal fibrosis with multi-foci of microcalcification, and free of tumor invasion.
4. Surgical margin, bag 2, further excision, free of tumor invasion or DCIS lesion with the distance less than 1.0-mm from ductal carcinoma in situ.
5. Breast, right, non-tumor part, breast conserving surgery, stromal fibrosis with scattered to clustered granular microcalcifications in sclerotic/unfolded ductuloacini, area of hemorrhage (which might be previous biopsy route), and no definite invasive tumor or DCIS lesion identified.
6. Skin, right breast, breast conserving surgery, area of granulation tissue formation and free of tumor invasion, DCIS lesion or Paget's cells.
7. The immunohistochemical study for the primary invasive tumor cells (performed in section A7): ER (positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in over 95% of tumor cells), PR (positive, 4/4, strong nuclear staining in 90% of tumor cells), HER2/neu (negative, -/+++, score 0), EGFR (neative, -/+++), CK5/14 (complete loss of peripheral expression in the invasive regions), p63 (loss of peripheral myoepithelial expression in the invasive components and preserved peripheral nuclear staining in DCIS regions), and Ki-67 (very low proliferative fraction: 1% in "hot-zone" regions).
8. Pathologic staging: T1aN0(sn)M0, stage IA (AJCC 7th edition, 2010, combining the pathology report 2013-21680 for sentinel lymph node).
[描述]
      The specimen is submitted in two separated bags labeled as 1: right breast and 2: additional margin, fixed in formalin. The specimen is resected on 13:20 and fixed in formalin on 13:30. The tumor lesion has been cut as received with loss orientation.  
      The specimen labeled as 1, removed by breast conserving surgery measures 6.5 x 4.8 x 3.2 cm in size. It includes a fusiform skin, measuring 3.3 x 0.6 cm in diameter. There are three whitish and elastic lesion, measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm, 1.4 x 1.2 cm and 1.6 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm in dimension, respectively, surrounded by fatty tissue. No obvious firmly tumor lesion is found. 
      The specimen labeled as 2 measures 3.2 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm in size. It is yellowish and elastic. 

      Representative tissues are taken and labeled as following:          Jar 1
      A1-3 (mapping): lesions with peripheral margins at 3 o'clock direction (inked green) and 9 o'clock direction (inked blue)
      A4: lesions with peripheral margins at 6 o'clock direction
      A5-7: lesion with base
      A8-9: lesion with anterior margin
      (the whitish and elastic lesions are submitted totally)
      B: representative breast tissue
      C: skin
      D1-2: separately submitted additional margin (all for section)
